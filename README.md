# TODOs:
 
**./aspect-sentiment.py**
- Pipe in list of tweets
- Pull out aspects & descriptions
   - Need to modify algo to inclue "not"s and whatnot
- Add sentiment to each of the words
- Potentially add Named Entities, to identify things like competitors, etc. 
   - Look into whether there are pre-existing lists of Named Entities

- Run all the words through frequency & see if that's more interesting
   - Probably still need to finish Freq Count file, to include "Words of Interest" list
   - Probably need to add in Lemma-tization, before grouping words?
   - This would also be where to add in Pronoun Resolution


**What are the other things that need to be done?**
